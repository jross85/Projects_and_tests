# Projects_and_tests
Simple projects I make to test myself as I learn Python

I'll never forget my roots, this where I started exactly one year ago. I embarked on my path of programming and never looked back.

I'll never forget the joy I felt when I wrote this simple text game Chapel Road. It was my first real program, but more importantly, it was the first time I ever fully committed to something. For the first time I invested in myself and now I know what it's like to hear people I love tell me they're proud of me. 


```python

choice_1 = raw_input() 
	if choice_1 == "Go down the hall": 
		print "You decide to head down the hall..."
		Hall() 
	elif choice_1 == "Head back downstairs": 
		dead() 
	else: 
		print "You must decide.."
		Upstairs() 
```
	
	
	Ah, the memories. I'll always remember the first time I wrote an actual program.
